============================================================================
1)  Look in the 'lib' directory.  There you'll find the library file 
'cuon-matrix-quat.js', an extended version of the book's rudimentary 
vector/matrix library ('cuon-matrix.js') that includes prototypes for
quaternion objects, complete with supporting functions.   
Add a line of text here to use that library in this simple program:
>

    <script src="../lib/cuon-matrix-quat03.js"></script>

<! 
2) Explore the 'cuon-matrix-quat.js' library.  In it you'll find objects 
'Vector3', 'Vector4' and 'Matrix4', which each have member functions to help 
you manipulate 3x1 vectors, 4x1 vectors and 4x4 matrices useful for 
computer graphics work, as well as a 'Quaternion' object we will now explore
for composing and interpolating rotations.  Got it?
--List all the functions available for use with Quaternions.
>
<!
3) Make some simple quaternions for testing; compare your results to those 
you create for same 3D axis+angles using this on-line quaternion calculator:
     http://www.energid.com/resources/orientation-calculator/ 

For example, make create these quaternions:
--q0: a LONG Quaternion (magnitude larger than 1) that rotates +30 degrees around +X axis.
--q1: a SHORT Quaternion that rotates by -45 degrees around the +Z axis
--q2: a Quaternion that rotates by +90 degrees around the (1,1,1) axis
--'Normalize' each of these quaternions and print them on-screen.
>
<!
4) Convert q0 and q1 to rotation matrices R0 and R1.
   Do they agree with our online calculator?
>
<!
5) Use Matrix4.concatenate() function (does 4x4 matrix multiply) to make two
new matrices by multiplying R0 and R1:
	[R01] = [R0][R1]  and 
  [R10] = [R1][R0]
>
<!
6) Similarly, use quaternion multiply function to make two new quaternions by
multiplying q0 and q1:
q01 = q0*q1 and q10 = q1*q0.
--Convert q01 and q10 to rotation matrices;  
   Do these match the online calculator's results?
   Which quaternions (q10 or q10) yields a rotation matrix that matches R01? R10? Why?
